## Week 1
### Personal Developments
#### Day 1
* Came up with new idea of the app
    * Previous app design was harder and not usable for all people (only members)
* Made a full proposal using the new app idea

#### Day 2
* Made the full design document.
* Starting designing the app (added all ViewControllers, added all classes and completed the storyboard).
    * During design of the storyboard I added two extra screens.
    * Screen was added for 'Add Expense' - Screen where you can edit all information about the expense.
    * Screen was added for 'Settings' - Screen where total expense amount and the different categories can be edited.
* Started programming the 'All Expenses' screen.

#### Day 3
* Created a working 'All Expenses' screen - Expenses can be added, edited and deleted.
    * Local storage is not yet implemented
    * Struggle with design of the datastructure (what is a logical way to pass information between the Controllers?)
* Created a working 'Add Expense' screen - All info of a expense can be changed and added to the all-expenses list.
    * Also added the option to edit the information of an existing entry.
