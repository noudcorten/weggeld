# Process Book


## Personal Developments
### Week 1
#### Day 1
* Came up with new idea of the app
    * Previous app design was harder and not usable for all people (only members)
* Made a full proposal using the new app idea

#### Day 2
* Made the full design document.
* Starting designing the app (added all ViewControllers, added all classes and completed the storyboard).
    * During design of the storyboard I added two extra screens.
    * Screen was added for 'Add Expense' - Screen where you can edit all information about the expense.
    * Screen was added for 'Settings' - Screen where total expense amount and the different categories can be edited.
* Started programming the 'All Expenses' screen.

#### Day 3
* Created a working 'All Expenses' screen - Expenses can be added, edited and deleted.
    * Local storage is not yet implemented
    * Struggle with design of the datastructure (what is a logical way to pass information between the Controllers?)
* Created a working 'Add Expense' screen - All info of a expense can be changed and added to the all-expenses list.
    * Also added the option to edit the information of an existing entry.

#### Day 4
* Made a huge mistake by deleting the entire app as a consequence of a hard reset using GIT.
    * Mistakes made using pull-requests.
* Spend rest of the day rebuilding the app.
* Finished the day by completely rebuilding the app and also adding PList Encoder.
    * PList Encoder had to option to save the list of expenses.

#### Day 5
* Plan of the day was to make a prototype in which everything worked ('Geld-Screen', 'Weg-Screen', 'Instellingen-Screen').
    * I skipped making the 'Statistieken-Screen', because this would take a lot of programming time.
    * Focussed on completing the interface with everyhthing working (and bug free!).
* Changed the PList Encoder to saving a class instead of a list.
    * This because a class can store a lot more information and a lot more efficient.
* Finished all of the three screens and made it entirely bug free (couldn't find any more bugs myself).

### Week 2
#### Day 1
* TWEEDE PINKSTERDAG

#### Day 2
* Finished the 'Geld-Screen'.
   * Added a loading bar in the form of a circle.
   * Added an animation for the loading bar.
   * Added an animation at the back of the loading bar which is pulsating, because this added more diversity.
   * Added an animation for the percentage label.
   * Added two labels which give the "Can still spend"- and "Already spend"-amounts.
* Added an icon to the app.
   * I managed to install the app on my iPhone (this was a problem because XCode didn't compile for iOS 12.3).
   * Adding an icon to the app made it look a lot more professional.

#### Day 3
* Installed pods
   * This is used for the 'Statistieken-Screen'.
   * Imported the 'Charts'-pod.
* Started working on the 'Statistieken-Screen'.
   * Added a scroll view so multiple statistics can be seen.
   * Added the first pie-chart using the 'Charts'-pod.

#### Day 4
* Continued working on the 'Statistieken-Screen'.
   * Tried to add a nice looking bar plot, but took very long because of little documentation.
* Made a lot of changes to the 'AppData-class', which is the class that stores all the information.
   * Created DateDict - output: year->month->[expenses] (all time)
   * Created categoryMonthMoneyDict - input: month, output: category->amount (per month)
   * Created categoryYearMoneyDict - input: year, output: category->amount (per year)
   * Created yearMoneyDict - input: year, output: month->amount (per year)
   * Created categoryDict - output: category->[expenses] (all time)
   * Created categoryMonthDict - output: category->amount (all time)
   

#### Day 5
* Finished a prototype of the app
   * Included bar graphs to the 'Statistieken-Screen'
   * Changed some code in 'Statistieken-Screen' so the colours in the pie-chart and bar-chart lined up
   * Cleaned some of the code
   * Started working on the category-editing system in 'Instellingen-Screen'
   
### Week 3
#### Day 1
* Finished the 'Instellingen-Screen'
   * Managed to add the whole category-editing system
   * Able to add and edit categories
   * Added some exceptions to remove bugs (no duplicates, every word starts with capital letter, no empty textfield, etc.)
   
#### Day 2
* Added colors to categories

* Changed 'Weg-Screen' to show selected colors

#### Day 3
* 'Statistieken-Screen'-colors now matches category colors
* Changed entire UI

#### Day 4
* Finished category editing
   * Able to change priority of category
* Removed bugs
