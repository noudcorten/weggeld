# Process Book


## Personal Developments
### Week 1
#### Day 1
* Came up with new idea of the app
    * Previous app design was harder and not usable for all people (only members)
* Made a full proposal using the new app idea

#### Day 2
* Made the full design document.
* Starting designing the app (added all ViewControllers, added all classes and completed the storyboard).
    * During design of the storyboard I added two extra screens.
    * Screen was added for 'Add Expense' - Screen where you can edit all information about the expense.
    * Screen was added for 'Settings' - Screen where total expense amount and the different categories can be edited.
* Started programming the 'All Expenses' screen.

#### Day 3
* Created a working 'All Expenses' screen - Expenses can be added, edited and deleted.
    * Local storage is not yet implemented
    * Struggle with design of the datastructure (what is a logical way to pass information between the Controllers?)
* Created a working 'Add Expense' screen - All info of a expense can be changed and added to the all-expenses list.
    * Also added the option to edit the information of an existing entry.

#### Day 4
* Made a huge mistake by deleting the entire app as a consequence of a hard reset using GIT.
    * Mistakes made using pull-requests.
* Spend rest of the day rebuilding the app.
* Finished the day by completely rebuilding the app and also adding PList Encoder.
    * PList Encoder had to option to save the list of expenses.

#### Day 5
* Plan of the day was to make a prototype in which everything worked ('Geld-Screen', 'Weg-Screen', 'Instellingen-Screen').
    * I skipped making the 'Statistieken-Screen', because this would take a lot of programming time.
    * Focussed on completing the interface with everyhthing working (and bug free!).
* Changed the PList Encoder to saving a class instead of a list.
    * This because a class can store a lot more information and a lot more efficient.
* Finished all of the three screens and made it entirely bug free (couldn't find any more bugs myself)
